Working in the fintech sector as a software developer requires a blend of technical skills and knowledge of financial concepts. Since you already have a background in Java and JavaScript, you are off to a good start. Here are more specific skills, technologies, and methodologies you may need to familiarize yourself with:

## Technical Skills

- **Databases**: Knowledge of SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB is crucial. You'll often need to create, read, update, and delete data from these databases [Source 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/essential-skills-and-tools-for-a-career-in-fintech-9a6b58a1c54f).

```java
// Connecting to a MySQL database using Java JDBC
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class MySQLDatabaseConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb";
        String user = "testuser";
        String password = "testpassword";

        try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
            System.out.println("Connected to MySQL database!");
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

- **Frameworks**: Familiarity with Java frameworks like Spring Boot and JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js is beneficial. These frameworks can help you build robust and scalable applications [Source 2](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/frameworks.html).

```java
// Creating a simple Spring Boot application
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    class HelloController {
        @GetMapping("/")
        public String hello() {
            return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
        }
    }
}
```

- **API Development**: Restful API development is often required in fintech. You may need to integrate with third-party services or expose your own services as APIs [Source 3](https://www.codementor.io/@npostolovski/40-developer-skills-for-financial-technology-fintech-developers-b129v8g2z).

```java
// Creating a RESTful API using Spring Boot
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class GreetingController {
    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting(@RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "World") String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
```

- **Microservices**: Fintech companies often use microservices architecture for their systems. Knowledge of how to develop, deploy, and manage microservices is valuable [Source 4](https://dzone.com/articles/microservices-in-fintech).

## Financial Knowledge

Understanding the financial sector is equally important. You should familiarize yourself with concepts like:

- **Financial Markets**: Understand the basics of how financial markets operate, including stocks, bonds, derivatives, and forex markets.

- **Regulations**: Familiarize yourself with financial regulations such as GDPR, PSD2, MiFID II, and others. These regulations can significantly impact how fintech products are developed and operate [Source 5](https://builtin.com/fintech/fintech-regulations-laws).

- **Financial Modeling**: Knowledge of financial modeling can be helpful, especially when working on products related to investment, lending, or risk management [Source 6](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/jobs/financial-modeler-job-description/).

## Methodologies

- **Agile Methodologies**: Most fintech companies use Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban for project management [Source 7](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-methodologies-financial-services-organizations-6679).

- **DevOps**: Understanding DevOps practices and tools (like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes) is often required for deploying and managing fintech applications [Source 8](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/18505/why-fintech-needs-devops).

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Fintech products often deal with sensitive data and transactions, so thorough testing is crucial. Familiarity with TDD and testing tools like JUnit (for Java) or Jest (for JavaScript) is beneficial [Source 9](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/test-driven-development-tdd/).

```java
// Simple JUnit test case
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestJunit {
   @Test
   public void testAdd() {
      String str = "JUnit is working fine";
      assertEquals("
