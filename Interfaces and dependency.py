Interfaces and dependency injection are important concepts in software development. Heres a brief explanation of each:

Interfaces: In programming, an interface is a contract or a blueprint for a class. It defines a set of methods and properties that a class implementing the interface must adhere to. Interfaces allow for abstraction, modularity, and flexibility in code design. They enable loose coupling, where classes depend on interfaces rather than specific implementations, promoting maintainability and testability.

Dependency Injection: Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that facilitates loose coupling and modularity in software systems. It involves providing dependencies (objects or services) to a class from an external source, rather than having the class create or manage its dependencies directly. DI helps achieve inversion of control (IoC) and promotes reusability, testability, and flexibility in software development.



Interfaces and dependency 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interfaces and Dependency Injection are two key concepts in software engineering, often used to write loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable code.

Interfaces in programming are contracts that define what methods an implementing class must have. They allow you to define specific methods that a class must implement, promoting a structured approach to programming and making your code more predictable and easier to understand. They are central to many programming principles and patterns, including the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) en.wikipedia.org.

Dependency Injection is a technique where an object receives other objects it depends on. These other objects are its dependencies. Instead of hardcoding the dependencies, they are provided at runtime. This allows for greater flexibility, as you can change the dependencies without changing the class that uses them. This technique is often used to keep code in line with the Dependency Inversion Principle, which states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions (like interfaces) en.wikipedia.org.
